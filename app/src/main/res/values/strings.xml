    Any quadratic equation can be represented in general form: \\(ax^2+bx+c=0\\),
    where \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are numeric coefficients before different powers of x.
    For example, in the equation \\(x^2+2x-4=0\\) the coefficients will be: \\(a=1\\), \\(b=2\\), \\(c=-4\\).
    Our application is able to solve equations written in a general form. However, general equations are not so common.
    Sometimes, before solving an equation, you must first bring it to a general form.
    If in your task you come across such a case, then do not be discouraged.
    Here are some examples of equations that are generalized.
    Example 1: \\(-3x^2=-5+0.5x\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(-3x^2-0.5x+5=0\\). Example 2: \\(11=x^2\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(-x^2+11=0\\).
    Please note that not only whole numbers, but also fractional numbers written in decimal form can act as coefficients (example 1).
    Also, pay attention to the fact that some of the general formulated equations may be missing (example 2).
    When writing an equation in our application, indicate 0 in front of such a coefficient.</string>
